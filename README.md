# ðŸŒ³ Tree Species Classification

A deep learning project for accurately classifying different tree species based on leaf images. This model aims to support ecological research, conservation efforts, and environmental monitoring by automating plant identification.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify tree species from image data. It was trained on a dataset of labeled leaf images representing multiple species. The goal is to provide a fast and accurate way to identify tree species based on visual characteristics.
